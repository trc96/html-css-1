        The Mile High...Hike
    </h2>
    <p1>
        Standing at a grand total of 5,790 ft., Angels Landing is the most renowned day hike in Zion National Park, and possibly all of Utah.
        While only 5.2-mile round trip with 1,500 feet of elevation gain, this trek has all the magnitude of a bucket list caliber hike akin to Half Dome in Yosemite.
        Segments of the perilous trail to Angels Landing are just a few feet wide with thousand foot drop-offs on both sides.
        If that prospect doesn’t make you queasy, you will find the hike exhilarating. The views are extraordinary and the trail itself is a feat of engineering.

        It's now famous name came from that quote made by a Methodist minister named Frederick Vining Fisher who, on his first visit to Zion Canyon in 1916 allegedly made that remark. 
        For the final half-mile, the trail follows the ridge across a saddle and up the Hogsback. 
        This is where things get just a tad hairy and you become very grateful for the bolted-in chains. 
        For those who are comfortable with both heights and the terrain ahead, the destination is well worth the adventurous route to get there. 
        From Angels Landing Summit you can enjoy one of the finest views in all of Zion National Park. 
        That means it’s one of the best views in Utah, which means it’s one of the best views in the world.
